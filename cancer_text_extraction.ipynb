    "Breast cancer clinical reports can contain errors, such as misspellings, which can break strict rule-based systems. However, our flexible and adaptable approach to report analysis can handle such errors without requiring explicit training on misspelled data. Our model can accurately extract relevant information, even when it is expressed in a non-standard or incorrect way. For example, we can successfully identify the phrase \"invasive ductal carcinoma\" even if it is misspelled as \"invasive ductal carinoma\" by using contextual clues and report structure."
