The specimen consists of multiple core biopsies of breast tissue. In areas, there is a fibroepithelial lesion containing benign stromal and epithelial components. There is no evidence of stromal atypia, increased mitoses, stromal condensation, or stromal overgrowth. The stromal component contains minimal cellularity and appears sclerotic. Areas of calcification are present with embedded within the stroma.     Overall, there is no evidence of atypical hyperplasia, in situ carcinoma, or invasive carcinoma.
